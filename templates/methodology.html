    <p>
        The data used for our airports is sourced from the Global Airport Database or GADB. This Database includes latitude-longitude coordinates for each airport,
        which we then use to calculate an as-the-crow-flies distance for each trip. This distance is then used alongside the UK government's Greenhouse Gas reports(similar
        figures were not readily available from the US government), which contain an estimate of Carbon Dioxide emissions per kilometer per passenger,
        in order to calculate a value of emissions over the course of the user's trips. This value can be easily used to determine a "tree equivalent" for the user's travel
        by dividing by one estimate of the Carbon Dioxide absorbed by the average mature tree over the course of a single year.
        <br>Once these values have been calculated on a per-passenger basis, they may be easily scaled up to a value for the entire flight by multiplying by 160, the Official
        Aviation Guide's estimate for the average ridership on a commercial flight. This may give the user a picture of not just their own emissions but the cumulative
        emissions of themselves and every flight they have held a seat on. This value is typically shockingly high even when the user travels infrequently and over short distances.
